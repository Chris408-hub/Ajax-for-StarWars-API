# Star Wars Character Guide

This project is a collaborative effort to create a responsive Star Wars character guide using the Star Wars API (SWAPI). 

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to utilize the SWAPI to fetch and display information about Star Wars characters. Each character in the guide acts as a link to the movies they appear in. When a character link is clicked, an AJAX call is made to retrieve details such as the movie title, opening crawl, and movie poster.
